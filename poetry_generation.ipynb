We could\\'ve had it all...\\nRollin\\' in the deep...\\nYou had my heart inside of your hand\\nAnd you played it to the beat\\nCould\\'ve had it all\\nRollin\\' in the deep\\nYou had my heart inside of your hand\\nBut you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I\\'ll be better without you,\\nThey don\\'t know you like I do,\\nOr at least as far as I thought I knew\\nI can\\'t bear this time,\\nIt drags, as I lose my mind\\nReminded by things I find\\nI know some clothes you left behind.\\nWake me up, wake me up when all is done\\nI won\\'t rise until this battle\\'s won\\nMy dignity is become undone But I won\\'t go\\nI can\\'t do it on my own\\nIf this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nI\\'m willing to take the risk\\nI won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own,\\nIf this is ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nI\\'m willing to take the risk So petrified, I\\'m so scared to step into this right,\\nWhat if I lose my heart and fail the ?\\nI won\\'t forgive me if I gave up trying\\nI heard his voice today\\nI didn\\'t know a single word he said\\nNow I\\'m resemblance to the man I met\\nJust a vague and broken boy instead But I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own\\nIf this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nI\\'m willing to take the risk\\nI won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own\\nIf this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nI\\'m willing to take the risk There will be times, we\\'ll try and give it up\\nBursting at the seams, no doubt\\nWe almost fall apart and burn up easy\\nSo watch them turn to dust\\nBut nothing will never taint us I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own\\nIf this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nI\\'m willing to take the risk\\nI won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own\\nIf this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nI\\'m willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?\\nWill he still love me even when he\\'s free\\nOr will he go back to the place where\\nHe will choose the poison over me?\\nWhen we spoke yesterday\\nHe said to hold my breath, to sit and wait\\nI\\'ll be home soon, I won\\'t be late He won\\'t go\\nHe can\\'t do it on his own\\nIf this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nHe\\'s willing to take the risk\\nSo I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on his own,\\nIf this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nI\\'m willing to take the risk \\'Cause he won\\'t go\\nHe can\\'t do it on his own\\nIf this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\nWe\\'re willing to take the risk\\nI won\\'t go!

kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they\\'re strong\\nBut my knees were far too weak\\nTo stand in your arms\\nWithout falling to your feet But there\\'s a side to you\\nThat I never knew, never knew\\nAll the things you\\'d say\\nThey were never true, never true\\nAnd the games you play\\nYou would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\nYour name When I lay with you\\nI could stay there\\nClose my eyes\\nFeel you here forever\\nYou and me together nothing gets better \\'Cause there\\'s a side to you\\nThat I never knew, never knew\\nAll the things you\\'d say\\nThey were never true, never true\\nAnd the games you play\\nYou would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,\\nYour name I set fire to the rain\\nAnd I threw us into the flames\\nWell, it felt something died\\n\\'Cause I knew that that was\\nThe last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,\\nThat heart you caught must be waiting for you\\nEven now when we\\'re already over\\nI can\\'t help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\nYour name I set fire to the rain,\\nAnd I threw us into the flames\\nWell, it felt something died\\n\\'Cause I knew that, that was the last time\\nThe last time Let it burn\\nLet it burn\\nLet it burn Daydreamer\\nSitting on the sea\\nSoaking up the sun\\nHe is a real lover\\nAnd making up the past\\nFeeling up his girl\\nLike he\\'s never felt a figure before A jaw dropper\\nLooks good when he walks\\nIs the subject of their talk\\nHe would be hard to chase\\nBut good to catch\\nAnd he could change the world\\nWith his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin\\' on your doorstep\\nWaiting for a surprise\\nAnd he will feel like he\\'s been there for hours\\nAnd you can tell that he\\'ll be there for life Daydreamer\\nWith eyes that make you melt\\nHe lends his coat for shelter\\nPlus he\\'s there for you\\nWhen he shouldn\\'t be\\nBut he stays all the same\\nWaits for you\\nThen sees you through There\\'s no way I\\nCould describe him\\nWhat I\\'ll say is\\nJust what I\\'m hoping for But I will find him sittin\\' on my doorstep\\nWaiting for a surprise\\nAnd he will feel like he\\'s been there for hours\\nAnd I can tell that he\\'ll be there for life\\nAnd I can tell that he\\'ll be there for life With your loving, there ain\\'t nothing\\nThat I can\\'t adore\\nThe way I\\'m running, with you, honey\\nIs we can break every low\\nI find it funny that you\\'re the only\\nOne I never looked for\\nThere is something in your loving\\nThat tears down my walls I wasn\\'t ready then, I\\'m ready now\\nI\\'m heading straight for you\\nYou will only be eternally\\nThe one that I belong to The sweetest devotion\\nHitting me like an explosion\\nAll of my life, I\\'ve been frozen\\nThe sweetest devotion I\\'ve known I\\'ll forever be whatever you want me to be\\nI\\'ll go under and all over for your clarity\\nWhen you wonder if I\\'m gonna lose my way home\\nJust remember, that come whatever, I\\'ll be yours all alone I wasn\\'t ready then, I\\'m ready now\\nI\\'m heading straight for you\\nYou will only be eternally\\nThe one that I belong to The sweetest devotion\\nHitting me like an explosion\\nAll of my life, I\\'ve been frozen\\nThe sweetest devotion I\\'ve known I\\'ve been looking for you, baby\\nIn every face that I\\'ve ever known\\nAnd there is something \\'bout the way you love me\\nThat finally feels like home\\nAll my life, you\\'re my darkness\\nYou\\'re the right kind of madness\\nAnd you\\'re my hope, you\\'re my despair\\nYou\\'re my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion\\nHitting me like an explosion\\nAll of my life, I\\'ve been frozen\\nThe sweetest devotion I\\'ve known Sweetest\\nIt\\'s the sweetest\\nSweetest\\nIt\\'s the sweetest\\nSweetest\\nIt\\'s the sweetest\\nSweetest\\nIt\\'s the sweetest\\nDevotion [Verse 1]\\nWhen did it go wrong, I will never know\\nI have loved you all my life\\nHow did it slow down, I go round and round\\nThinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]\\nI gave you heaven on a platter baby\\nI gave you everything you never gave me\\nI never lied and I never faked it\\nOnly wanted for you to save me\\nThis love, it ain\\'t over yet\\nThere\\'s too much that I haven\\'t said [Chorus]\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\nIt was hard to write, had a lump in my throat\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Verse 2]\\nWhy were you so cold, let the truth be told\\nTell me was it all for the thrill?\\nWhat was I thinking, I gave you everything\\nBut you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]\\nI gave you heaven on a platter baby\\nI gave you everything you never gave me\\nI never lied and I never faked it\\nOnly wanted for you to save me [Chorus]\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\nIt was hard to write, had a lump in my throat\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Bridge]\\nOooh sometimes I feel like I\\'m in the dark\\nOooh I thought I\\'d die in your arms [Chorus]\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\nIt was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Outro]\\nHope you know, I won\\'t let go I thought I told you, he\\'d be home soon\\nCouldn\\'t help myself, you\\'re too good to be true.\\nI fall short each time,\\nEvery time he ain\\'t here\\nYou and your charm creep closer\\nCloser and near\\nLike a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.\\nLike a bomb before explosion,\\nTicking by your call,\\nYou\\'re the wiser one, disguised from greed,\\nAnd I\\'m just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,\\nThan I ever did you before,\\nSo stand beside the river I cried,\\nAnd lay yourself down.\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you. So, you thought that I\\'d crumble to my knees\\nAt the first sight of you crawling back to me\\nTo whisper \"will you leave your man? \"\\nCause you swear that this time you can stand by me.\\nI won\\'t stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,\\nThan I ever did you before,\\nSo stand beside the river I cried\\nAnd lay yourself down.\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! I ain\\'t yours for no taking,\\nYou must be mistaken\\nI could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong\\nAnd ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,\\nThan you ever did me before.\\nSo stand beside the river you cried\\nAnd lay yourself down!\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! Found myself today singing out your name,\\nYou said I\\'m crazy,\\nIf I am I\\'m crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here\\nTurns me crazy,\\nBut it\\'s you who makes me lose my head. And every time I\\'m meant to be acting sensible\\nYou drift into my head\\nAnd turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I\\'ll race,\\nIf you want me to stop I\\'ll freeze,\\nAnd if you want me gone. I\\'ll leave, just hold me closer baby,\\nAnd make me crazy for you.\\nCrazy for you. Lately with this state I\\'m in I can\\'t help myself but spin.\\nI wish you\\'d come over,\\nSend me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it\\'s sweet taste for you,\\nStrips me down bare\\nAnd gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,\\nBut the more I do,\\nThe crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,\\nHoping you\\'ll walk through\\nAnd save me boy,\\nBecause I\\'m too crazy for you.\\nCrazy for you Everybody tells me it\\'s \\'bout time that I moved on\\nAnd I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young\\nBut my heart is a valley, it\\'s so shallow and man made\\nI\\'m scared to death if I let you in that you\\'ll see I\\'m just a fake\\nSometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch\\nBut I know that\\'s just me, \\'cause nothing ever is enough\\nWhen I was a child I grew up by the River Lea\\nThere was something in the water, now that something\\'s in me\\nOh I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\nI can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain\\nSo I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\nYeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it\\'s way too late\\nThat I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face\\nConsider this my apology, I know it\\'s years in advance\\nBut I\\'d rather say it now in case I never get the chance\\nNo, I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\nI can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\nYeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\nYeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham\\nIf it hadn\\'t been for love\\nI never woulda

own\\nYou can say I chose to be alone\\nWho wants to be right as rain\\nIt\\'s harder when you\\'re on top \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off\\nAnd I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned\\nSo wipe that dirty smile off\\nWe won\\'t be making up\\nI\\'ve cried my heart out\\nAnd now I\\'ve had enough of love Who wants to be riding high\\nWhen you\\'ll just crumble back on down\\nYou give up everything you are\\nAnd even then you don\\'t get far\\nThey make believe that everything\\nIs exactly what it seems\\nBut at least when you\\'re at your worst\\nYou know how to feel things \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off\\nAnd I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned\\nSo wipe that dirty smile off\\nWe won\\'t be making up\\nI\\'ve cried my heart out\\nAnd now I\\'ve had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart\\nTo make me cry again\\n\\'Cause it will never hurt\\nAs much as it did then\\nWe were both right\\nAnd no one had blame\\nBut now I give up\\nOn this endless game \\'Cause who wants to be right as rain\\nIt\\'s better when something is wrong\\nI get excitement in my bones\\nEven though everything\\'s a strain\\nWhen night comes and I\\'m on my own\\nYou should know I chose to be alone\\nWho wants to be right as rain\\nIt\\'s harder when you\\'re on top \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off\\nAnd I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned\\nSo wipe that dirty smile off\\nWe won\\'t be making up\\nI\\'ve cried my heart out\\nAnd now I\\'ve had enough of love No room in my bed\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned\\nSo wipe that dirty smile off\\nWe won\\'t be making up\\nI\\'ve cried my heart out\\nAnd now I\\'ve had enough of love So little to say but so much time\\nDespite my empty mouth the words are in my mind\\nPlease wear the face, the one where you smile\\nBecause you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I\\'m tired\\nI need to get away to feel again\\nTry to understand why, don\\'t get so close to change my mind\\nPlease wipe that look out of your eyes, it\\'s bribing me to doubt myself\\nSimply, it\\'s tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind\\nAnd if I stay I\\'ll be alive\\nThen choke on words I\\'d always hide\\nExcuse me first love, but we\\'re through\\nI need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I\\'m too tired\\nI\\'m bored to say the least and I, I lack desire\\nForgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love\\nForgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end\\nHold your breath and count to ten\\nFeel the earth move and then\\nHear my heart burst again For this is the end\\nI\\'ve drowned and dreamt this moment\\nSo overdue I owe them\\nSwept away, I\\'m stolen Let the skyfall\\nWhen it crumbles\\nWe will stand tall\\nFace it all together Let the skyfall\\nWhen it

by accident\\nIt blew me away\\nBlew me away It was in the darkest of my days\\nWhen you took my sorrow and you took my pain\\nAnd buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you\\nWhen the day is done\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\nYou disappear one day\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station\\nPut a kiss on top of your head\\nWatch you wave\\nAnd watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers\\nAnd neon lights and waiting papers\\nThat I call home\\nI call that home I wish I could lay down beside you\\nWhen the day is done\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\nYou disappear one day\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted\\nI\\'m going back to where I started\\nThe morning rain, the morning rain\\nAnd though I wish that you were here\\nOn that same old road that brought me here\\nIt\\'s calling me home, It\\'s calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you\\nWhen the day is done\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\nYou disappear one day\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away\\nI can\\'t spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there\\'s air made of bricks\\nPulls me down turns me weak for you\\nI find myself repeating like a broken tune\\nAnd I\\'m forever excusing your intentions\\nThat I give in to my pretendings\\nWhich forgive you each time\\nWithout me knowing\\nThey melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\nYou say my name like there could be an us\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love\\nI\\'m the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave\\nI feel my heart begin to burst and bleed\\nSo desperately I try to link it with my head\\nBut instead I fall back to my knees\\nAs you tear your way right through me\\nI forgive you once again\\nWithout me knowing\\nYou\\'ve burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\nYou say my name like there could be an us\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love\\nI\\'m the only one in love Why do you steal my hand\\nWhenever I\\'m standing my own ground\\nYou build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up\\nI say your name like there should be an us\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one, in love\\nI\\'m the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you\\nAnd fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette\\nAnd my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you\\'d understand\\nAnd thinking you would listen to all of the things\\nThe things I had planned But we couldn\\'t see eye to eye\\nSo darling\\nDarling\\nDarling this is goodbye Oh\\nI still care\\nFool that I am\\nOoh\\nI still care\\nFool that I am You say it\\'s all in my head\\nAnd the things I think just don\\'t make sense\\nSo where you been then? Don\\'t go all coy\\nDon\\'t turn it round on me like it\\'s my fault\\nSee I can see that look in your eyes\\nThe one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you\\nYou make it look like I\\'m see-through\\nDo tell me why you waste our time\\nWhen your heart ain\\'t in it, and you\\'re not satisfied\\nYou know I know just how you feel\\nI\\'m starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool\\n(Just for you)\\nEven in the daylight when you think that\\n(I don\\'t see you)\\nTry to look for things I hear but our eyes never find\\nThough I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]\\nWhy do you love me\\nDo you love me...?\\nWhy do you love me\\nDo you love me?\\nWhy do you love me\\nDo you love me?

that\\nI think you\\'re giving out in way too much in fact\\nI say we\\'ve only known each other one year\\nYou say I\\'ve known you longer my dear\\nYou like to be so close, I like to be alone\\nI like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor\\nWalking with each other,\\nThink we\\'ll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face\\nFrom the deepest part of my regret\\nI hear the words I wish I\\'d said\\nAt the dawning of the day\\nI can\\'t wait to see the light\\nMake up memories in my head\\nThey help to fill the emptiness you\\'ve left\\nI can\\'t drown in your tears\\nI won\\'t face your fears\\nI need to fight my own\\nYou\\'ll never see me again oh baby in time\\nLet the weight take me under\\nI know I\\'ll survive\\nYou\\'ll never see me

only one request of your life\\nThat you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days\\nAll the nickels and the dimes of your days\\nLet the reasons and the rhymes of your days\\nAll begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light\\nIn the fields of dawn and the forests of the night\\nAnd when you stand before the candles on a cake\\nOh, let me be

for days on end and\\nIt\\'s been waiting for you to open up\\nYours too baby, come on now\\nI\\'m trying to tell you just how\\nI\\'d like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally\\nSay that it\\'s always been me That\\'s made you feel the way you\\'ve never felt before\\nAnd I\\'m all you need and that you never want more\\nThen you\\'d say all of the right things without a clue\\nBut you\\'d save the best for last\\nLike I\\'m the one for you You should know that you\\'re just a temporary fix\\nThis is not rooted with you it don\\'t mean that much to me\\nOh just a filler in the space that happened to be free\\nHow dare you think you\\'d get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I\\'ve tried my hardest\\nIt turns out it ain\\'t enough\\nYou\\'re still not mentioning love\\nWhat am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?\\nI\\'m taking these chances and getting nowhere\\nAnd though I\\'m trying my hardest you go back to her\\nAnd I think that I know things may never change\\nI\\'m still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you\\'ve never felt before\\nAnd I\\'m all you need and that you never want more\\nThen you\\'d say all of the right things without a clue\\nBut you\\'d save the best for last\\nLike I\\'m the one for you You should know that you\\'re just a temporary fix\\nThis is not rooted with you it don\\'t mean that much to me\\nOh just a filler in the space that happened to be free\\nHow dare you think you\\'d get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know\\nI find it hard to let go and give up on you\\nSeems I love the things you do\\nLike the meaner you treat me the more eager I am\\nTo persist with this heartbreak and running around\\nAnd I will do until I\\'m finding myself you And make you feel a way you\\'ve never felt before\\nAnd be all you need so that you never want more\\nAnd you\\'ll say all of the right things without a clue\\nAnd you\\'ll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,\\nAnd as it fell you rose to claim it\\nIt was dark and I was over\\nUntil you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they\\'re strong\\nBut my knees were far too weak\\nTo stand in your arms\\nWithout falling to your feet But there\\'s a side to you\\nThat I never knew, never knew\\nAll the things you\\'d say\\nThey were never true, never true\\nAnd the games you play\\nYou would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\nYour name When I lay with you\\nI could stay there\\nClose my eyes\\nFeel you here forever\\nYou and me together nothing gets better \\'Cause there\\'s a side to you\\nThat I never knew, never knew\\nAll the things you\\'d say\\nThey were never true, never true\\nAnd the games you play\\nYou would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,\\nYour name I set fire to the rain\\nAnd I threw us into the flames\\nWell, it felt something died\\n\\'Cause I knew that that was\\nThe last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,\\nThat heart you caught must be waiting for you\\nEven now when we\\'re already over\\nI can\\'t help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\nYour name I set fire to the rain,\\nAnd I threw us into the flames\\nWell, it felt something died\\n\\'Cause I knew that, that was the last time\\nThe last time Let it burn\\nLet it burn\\nLet it burn [Adele]\\nI would never lie to you unless you
